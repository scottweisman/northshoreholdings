Â Our experience will help make the transition to your new home easy.</p>

			<p>Although the majority of our buildings are located in the Lincoln Park, Lakeview and Ravenswood neighborhoods, ICM Properties is continuing to expand in many different areas on the north side of Chicago. From new construction condo-quality buildings with all the touches of a contemporary home to large mid-rise buildings rehabbed with modern luxuries, ICM has the right apartment for you.</p>
