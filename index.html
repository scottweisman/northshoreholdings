				<h4>Ken and Chris have been AMAZING! Juan their maintenance guy is on it. They are on top of everything! If there is an issue I can email or call them or submit a work order. Having the online bill pay which you can set up auto pay is great.</h4>
				<cite>Robert W. - South Elgin, IL</cite>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote class="quotes">
				<h4>Ken has been my landlord for over a year -- during this time he has been overwhelmingly responsive and professional. Recently, our dishwasher broke - with three kids this was a huge hassle to hand wash dishes after each meal -- Ken responded within the hour and the next day we got a call from ABT to schedule the delivery of our new dishwasher!</h4>
				<cite>Sheila T. - Wilmette, IL</cite>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote class="quotes">
				<h4>Since the first time I called North Shore requesting to see one of their rental properties, they have been incredibly responsive and accomodating.  The house that I'm renting was fully renovated by North Shore and was in move-in condition. Every time I have emailed or texted Ken with an issue, I have received a response within an hour....actually, usually within 15 minutes. </h4>
				<cite>Heidi B. - Glenview, IL</cite>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote class="quotes">
				<h4>I have been a tenant of Ken from North Shore Holdings for about a year now, if your looking for a rental unit, I would give them a call. I have not had many problems with our unit but as soon as I post a issue, I get a text message or a phone call, always from Ken the owner. the problem is taken care of immediately. Ken and North Shore are #1 in my book.</h4>
				<cite>Joe M. - Bartlett, IL</cite>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote class="quotes">
				<h4>I have been renting from North Shore Holdings and have to say that they are a great landlord.  The property I am renting is a complete gut rehab and the quality and workmanship is outstanding.  Any maintenance request I have ever had has been taken care of within days.  I did not have the greatest credit when I applied for the house and Ken treated me as more than just my credit score.  Joanna there is fantastic!  Would not hesitate to rent from them again.</h4>
